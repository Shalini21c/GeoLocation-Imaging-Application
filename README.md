# GeoLocation-Imaging-Application

This application will give image results according to your current location. It will first hit the API of OpenCage app and then the API of Unsplash.
Home, About, Feedback, Login will hit nowhere as they are dummy. Someone can make changes for their functioning in their code. As in my case the stress is on providing the user their current location.

**Note: *Use your own APIs in the above two cases.
